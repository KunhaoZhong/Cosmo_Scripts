# Non-linear Scale Cuts

for_cmb
-------
This is a example of how to determine which scale the non-linear calculation doesn't matter. By comparing the chi2 such that at certain scale using non-linear calculations in Boltzman code or not doesn't matter, we can see that for CMB anisotropies(mostly in nonlinear lensing), this is about l=1600 (see the output file).

3x2pt scale cut
---------------

Using the same idea as in cmb, but for scale cut for 3x2pt analysis. The script is for LSST analysis.
