# Non-linear Scale Cuts
This is a example of how to determine which scale the non-linear calculation doesn't matter. By comparing the chi2 such that at certain scale using non-linear calculations in Boltzman code or not doesn't matter, we can see that for CMB anisotropies(mostly in nonlinear lensing), this is about l=1600 (see the output file).

It can also be used as a template to determine the scale cuts for weak lensing.
