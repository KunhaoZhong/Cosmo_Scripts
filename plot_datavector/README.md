# Plot data vector for 3x2 week lensing, galaxy-galaxy lensing, and galaxy clustering 2PCF

This is a example of plotting the observables xi_plus/minus for weekk lensing, gamma_t for galaxy-galaxy lensing, and w_theta for galaxy clustering. 

There are plots in the jupyter notebook.

The data point is from the real data, and error bars from the covariance matrix. The solid line is the model, you can creat your own by print_data_vector function in cosmolike/cocoa.
